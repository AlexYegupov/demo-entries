Demonstrates React practices.
Used create-react-app as boilerplate.

Made by Alexey Yegupov

## Specification

The goal is to create a wireframe components (a style doesn't matter, it can
be black & white with borders) to represent following an application
components:

+ logo
+ app switch between "main app" mode and "admin" mode
+ main menu

When a user will click to app mode then the menu background colour should
change (eg from white to light gray) and it's content: in the main app mode we
should have the following menu entries:
Entry1, Entry2, Entry3, Entry4, Entry5
In the admin mode:
AdminEntry1, AdminEntry2, AdminEntry3

Currently clicked menu entry should be higlighted (eg if I click on Entry2 it
should have different colour or background then other entries).

Objective: create a simple HTML page with react components to represent the
switch functionality.

Goals:
+ Use latest React version.
+ Use the best React practice (latest ones!).
+ Don't repeat yourself,
+ Try to compose.
+ Keep it simple, don't complicate. It's the clean code which matters, not
amount the of styles.

The layout should be similar to the following wireframe:
